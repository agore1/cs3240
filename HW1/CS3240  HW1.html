<h2>CS3240:&nbsp; Homework 1<br>
</h2>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Deadline and submission rules:</span>&nbsp;
See where this assignment was announced.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Collaboration rules:</span><br>
You must write the code and answer the report questions on your own.
You may only talk to other students about questions related to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">understanding the problem</span>,
i.e. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">what</span> we want you
to do. &nbsp;But you may not talk about <span style="text-decoration: underline;">how to solve it</span>, either
about design or about coding. You may not talk or get help from anyone
outside the class other that the TAs and instructor, including students
who are not in the class this term.<br>
<br>
The following is a simplified version of a problem in statistical
pattern recognition or data mining. The problem is called the k-nearest
neighbor (k-NN) problem.&nbsp; This is a method for doing
classification, which is a problem where each of a large set of data
items has a
vector of data values assigned to it, and each data item belongs to a
category.&nbsp; A data item of unknown classification must be
"classified", i.e. assigned to one category based on the known
classification of the previously-classified data items.&nbsp; If k = 1,
this is called the nearest-neighbor method.<br>
<br>
An example:&nbsp; medical data values (e.g. weight, BMI, family
history, etc.) are recorded for a large number of people when they were
40 years old. The two categories are whether or not they developed
diabetes by the time they turned 65.&nbsp; For new 40-year-old
patients, we want to predict if they will develop diabetes or
not.&nbsp; We use the medical data values for each new patient and
classify it based on the large data set of known classification.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Problem specification:</span><br>
<br>
A large number of M data items are represented by a pair of values
(X,Y) and a label.&nbsp; The label represents one of a fixed set of
categories. (For this problem, we'll say there are just two categories,
and your solution can assume that.&nbsp; In this explanation, we'll
call these
<span style="font-style: italic;">cat1</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">cat2</span>, but the data file could
contain different strings for the category names.)&nbsp; A new data
item with its own (X,Y) value is to be
processed against each of these data items and the Euclidean distance
between the pair of (X,Y) values is calculated.&nbsp; We'll find the k
items that are closest to the new data item and use those k items and
their given category as described
below. &nbsp;(Euclidean distance between two points is pretty simple,
but if you've forgotten see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance">Wikipedia</a>.)<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Program inputs:</span><br>
<ul>
  <li>Value of k: prompt the user for a value of k.</li>
  <li>Value of M: prompt the user for the value of M, the number of
values to be read from the data file.&nbsp; This could be smaller than
the number of values actually found in the data file.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Data file name: prompt the user for the name of a data file
containing the classified data items.&nbsp; Each item will be on a line
by itself, where each line is the category value (a string) followed by
the X and
Y values (all separated by 1 or more spaces).&nbsp; X and Y may be any
floating point values (negative, positive or zero).</li>
  <li>Unclassified data values: prompt the user for (X,Y) value
pairs.&nbsp; Keep prompting and processing these (see below) until the
user enters values that are 1.0 and 1.0 (yes, this is kind of dumb but
it's
simple).<span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp; Clarification:&nbsp;</span>
the user just enters two numbers, without any parentheses or commas. <br>
Example:&nbsp; <span style="font-family: monospace;">-3.2 1.7</span><br>
  </li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Calculations and outputs:</span><br>
For each unclassified data-item that is entered, do the following:<br>
<ol>
  <li>Print the set of k data items that are closest to each
unclassified data-item in non-decreasing order (i.e. nearest first).
For each item, print its category, (X,Y) values, and distance to the
unclassified data item on a separate line.&nbsp; (See example below.)<br>
  </li>
  <li>Print which category this data-item would be assigned to, based
on whether the majority of the k-nearest-neighbors belong to the first
or second category. &nbsp;This "voting" is how the k-nearest-neighbor
algorithm classifies the data-item.&nbsp; This line can be in any
format, as long as the last token on the line is the category-value.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Print the average distance of the k-nearest-neighbors to the
data-item for each of the two categories. &nbsp;(This is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> how k-NN makes a
decision about classification, but your program should do it anyway.
)&nbsp; Print one line for each category, and they can be in any format
as long as the distance value is the last token on the line.<br>
    <br style="text-decoration: underline;">
    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Be careful about
following these output specifications.</span> We will attempt to grade
your program's output automatically.<br>
  </li>
</ol>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Example results:</span><br>
Say that&nbsp;k=5, the unclassified data-item has value (0,0),&nbsp;
and the nearest neighbors turn out to be:<br>
<pre>cat2&nbsp;&nbsp; 2&nbsp; 0<br>cat1&nbsp;0.5&nbsp; 0<br>cat2&nbsp;&nbsp; 1&nbsp; 0<br>cat1&nbsp;&nbsp; 0&nbsp; 0<br>cat2&nbsp;&nbsp; 0&nbsp; 3</pre>
Then the output for item (1) described above might look something like
this:<br>
<span style="font-family: monospace;">cat1 0 0 0.0<br>
cat1 0.5 0 0.5<br>
cat2 1 0 1.0<br>
cat2 2 0 2.0<br>
cat2 0 3 3.0</span><br>
<br>
The output for item (2) described above might look something like this:<br>
<span style="font-family: monospace;">Data item (0,0) assigned to: cat2</span><br>
(This is because the "vote" for cat2 is 3-to-2 among the k=5 nearest
neighbors.)<br>
<br>
The output for (3) might look something like this:<br>
<span style="font-family: monospace;">Average distance to cat1
items:&nbsp; 0.25</span><br style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;">Average distance to cat2
items:&nbsp; 2.0</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Constraints:</span><br>
<ul>
  <li>Use an object-oriented design for your solution.&nbsp; Use
classes as appropriate.&nbsp; Use any OO
language you wish.</li>
  <li>Make use of standard libraries or other reusable components if
this is useful.</li>
  <li>Assume that this program could be used to process large data
sets. Your design choices should take this into account.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Document any error checking you do in the report (see below).</li>
  <li>Document any assumptions or changes you make in the report (see
below).</li>
  <li>Comments are not required other than a header in the main file
listing your name and contact info.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Update on next two
items!&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">Do not Zip
any of your files. Just submit all of them to Collab as individual
files.&nbsp; See Piazza post for more on this. One of these files must
be the run-hw1.sh file described below.</span><br>
  </li>
  <li>Submit <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">two</span>
files to Collab.&nbsp; One will be a PDF or .txt file with your
report.&nbsp; <br>
  </li>
  <li><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">The 2nd file you
submit will be a Zip file named </span><span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: line-through;">hw1-mst3k.zip</span><span style="text-decoration: line-through;"> (where "mst3k" is replaced by
your user-ID)</span> that contains all
source files required, plus a shell-script named <span style="font-weight: bold;">run-hw1.sh</span> that compiles and runs
your program under Linux.
We will give you lots of examples of how to write this shell-script, so
don't panic.&nbsp; The idea is that a grader can unzip you're file and
then execute that script and your program will run without the grader
having to figure out to compile and run it.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
Note: If you find that the above specification unsatisfying for any
reason, be aware of item 3 of the report you have to write (see below).<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
<br>
Report:</span><br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration: line-through;"></span>Submit a PDF or
text file that has answers to the following
questions ("the
report"): &nbsp;<br>
<ol>
  <li>Name any <span style="font-style: italic;">abstract data types</span>
that are important in your program (if any).</li>
  <li>Briefly describe any major <span style="font-style: italic;">data
structures</span>
that you use and for what purpose in your program. &nbsp;If you used
things from a standard library (or other reusable components), mention
those here.</li>
  <li>If you can think of any ways this problem statement is a bad
requirements specification, briefly list <span style="text-decoration: underline;">at most three</span>
problems. &nbsp;This may be missing or confusing requirements. &nbsp;If
you list anything here and you had to make an assumption or a change to
make a working program, explain that.</li>
  <li>Briefly describe your design in terms of the program components
you are using. &nbsp;(We are deliberately not telling you exactly how
to describe this. &nbsp;Describe your design in a brief but useful way
-- imagine that you wanted a fellow student to understand how to do
this without giving them your code.)</li>
  <li>Briefly describe any error checking you did in your
program.&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Or could have done.</span><br>
  </li>
  <li>Briefly describe three good test cases that you did (or should
have done) to test that your code is correct. &nbsp;Say why your set of
test cases are good choices.</li>
  <li>(The answer to this part will not affect your grade at all. We're
curious.) &nbsp;How many hours did you spend on coding this assignment?
&nbsp;(Please be honest. &nbsp;We won't hold this against you in any
way!)</li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">How we'll grade this report:</span><br>
We'll read your report pretty rapidly, looking to see if you have a
good grasp of the high-level ideas we're looking for. &nbsp;We won't be
reading for too much detail. &nbsp;We'll grade each part with a fairly
simple grading-rubric: <br>
5: knows it well. &nbsp;4: pretty good but could be better; &nbsp; 3:
acceptable but needs work; &nbsp;2: just below acceptable; &nbsp;1:
well below acceptable<br>
<br>
We really think you do not need long answers for these questions.&nbsp;
If you find yourself writing a lot, try to make
explain it more briefly. Also, it's important for this class that you
communicate clearly and concisely, and that padding reports or
documents with extra words makes for bad written communication.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">A Picture Might Be Worth a Thousand
Words:</span><br>
In the picture below (from Wikipedia):<br>
<ul>
  <li>The green circle is an unclassified point (one where the user has
entered the X,Y values.</li>
  <li>The blue squares are points of one of the two categories, and the
red triangles are points from the 2nd category.&nbsp; (These are read
from the data file.)</li>
</ul>
Let's say k has value 3.&nbsp; Then of all the blue squares and red
triangles, the ones inside the solid circle are the three nearest
neighbors.&nbsp; In this case, 2 of the 3 are red triangles, so we'd
classify the green circle as being in that category.<br>
<br>
But let's say k has value 5.&nbsp; The five nearest neighbors are the
ones insides the dashed circle.&nbsp; In this case, 3 of the 5 are blue
squares, so we'd classify the green circle as being in that category.<br>
<br>
Note: the circles are used to just show which ones are the k-nearest
neighbors here. You are not calculating circles for this problem.<br>
