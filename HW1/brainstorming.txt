Breaking down the problem:
*Read some data from command line
*Read the input file
	*Get a line
	*Parse that line into words to store into variables
*Store a dynamic number of input points. 
*Compute the nearest neighbors
*Print out the results of the nearest neighbors

The data point class should have: 
*Members for the x and y fields - floats
*Member for the category

Assignment file problems: 
Doesn't give much info on what kind of category names to expect: will they include spaces, etc? 
Doesn't give an example file. 

Overall problem solving:
*For all points in  allPoints, calculate it's distance from the input point
*Sort them by their distance
*Or keep a running list of the K nearest ones, and upon calculating a distance, see if it's less than the largest value currently in the list. 
*Print the K nearest ones
*Vote with the K nearest ones
	*make a dictionary 
	*read category, increment value
*Clear the distances, then begin again.
