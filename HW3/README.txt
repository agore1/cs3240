Although I finished documenting test cases for the graph functions, I did not have enough time to code them all, or the implementations of the graph functions. As constructive feedback, I would like to note that I feel this lab was quite tedious. After writing 10 test cases I felt like I had the hang of nose, TDD, coverage, etc., while the next 15 just felt repetitive and unhelpful. Overall I did like the TDD experience, though.
