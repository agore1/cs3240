During this lab I experienced difficulties with the provided files not resolving imports, and later with Pycharm's integrated coverage.py not working properly in conjunction with nose. After hours spent on these issues, I unfortunately don't have enough time to thoroughly test the rest of my code as described in the specification document. I have, however, assembled a small number of test cases to demonstrate the usage of these tools. 

This small number of tests did not reveal any bugs in my code, nor did they reveal any uncovered parts of my code.
